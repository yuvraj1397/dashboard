# Single Page Application

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React using Create React App.

## Overview

This project utilizes Create React App, a popular tool for quickly setting up React applications. This is a dashboard. It follows the principles of a Single Page Application, where the entire application runs within a single HTML page, dynamically updating as users interact with it without the need for full page reloads.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
